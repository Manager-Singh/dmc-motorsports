			<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
			<h5>How much will it cost to ship my order?</h5>
			<p>Most orders over $79 ship free! Click here to view our complete shipping policy</p>
			<h5>When will my order ship?</h5>
			<p>Most orders placed before 5:00 PM ET will ship the same business day.</p>
			<h5>I need my order fast. What are my options?</h5>
			<p>Due to increased order volume, not all shipping methods are available at this time. We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
			<h5>Why is Ground Shipping my only shipping option?</h5>
			<p>Any order containing hazardous materials, including motor oil, aerosol cans, or chemicals, must ship via ground service, regardless of destination. The shipment of these materials is federally regulated, and exceptions are not allowed. Customers may request that non-hazardous merchandise be shipped separately for a shipping fee of $12 by calling customer service at 1-678-928-2123. Orders containing oversized products such as ramps, ATV tires, or ATV plastic kits also ship via ground service.</p>
			<h5>Can my order be shipped internationally?</h5>
			<p>Yes, DMC Motorsports ships internationally. Extra shipping cost required.</p>
			<h5>Can I ship my order to an address other than my billing address?</h5>
			<p>Address verification is a precautionary measure DMC Motorsports performs to ensure your safety and deter fraudulent activity. The nature of online shopping does not permit us to request a traditional form of identification, such as a driver's license, like a standard brick & mortar store. We instead conduct address verification through your credit/debit card issuer to confirm your identity and verify the validity of your purchase, ultimately protecting your credit and privacy.</p> 
			<p>If you wish to ship to an address other than your billing address, we offer a couple of different options:</p>
			<p>You can contact your issuing bank and have your shipping destination added as an authorized alternate ship-to address in the record/memo field. We will contact your bank using the bank number you provide to verify this information after you've placed an order. We also offer a Pre-Authorization process to ship to alternate addresses. This pre-authorization process ensures that the card, account, and cardholder information is correct. We approve a small pre-authorized dollar amount to your card (less than $2.00) and have it confirmed by you, the customer. This charge will then be canceled, and your order will ship to the alternate address. If you do not see this charge on your account, give us a call at 1-678-928-2123, and we will re-attempt address verification to complete the processing of your order.</p> 
			<p>Please allow an extra day to verify any alternate ship-to address. Orders with the same billing and shipping address are more likely to ship same-day.</p>
			<h5>How do I track the status of my order?</h5>
			<p>The status of your order can be tracked by logging in to your account using the link in the upper right corner of every page or you can click here to log in.</p>
			<p>If you were sent a FedEx tracking number click here or call 1-800-463-3339 to track your package.</p>
			<h5>Can I pick up my order at your warehouse in Buford, GA?</h5>
			<p>Yes, come on in!</p>
			<h5>How can I tell if an item is in stock and ready to ship?</h5>
			<p>Estimated item availability is displayed on each product detail page at DMC Motorsports. If you have a question about the availability of a specific product, please contact one of our Sales Departments: 1-678-928-2123.</p>
			<h5>When will an order with an out-of-stock item ship?</h5>
			<p>For orders that include back-ordered items, DMC Motorsports will hold the order until all items are in stock. Once all items are in stock, DMC Motorsports will ship the complete order. Customers may request that in-stock items be shipped as soon as possible, with back-ordered items shipped when available. Please note: an additional $10 fee may apply in these situations. For orders split into separate shipments, the back-ordered items will ship via ground service once they are in stock. For additional questions, please contact our customer service department at 1-678-928-2123</p>
			<h5>Can you special order a product/part for me?</h5>
			<p>If the part is available through one of our suppliers, we would be happy to order it for you. Please contact one of our sales professionals to inquire about special orders and availability: 1-678-928-2123</p>
			<h5>How can I find parts for my specific ride?</h5>
			<p>First select the year, make, and model of your bike from the Model Selector located at the top of each page. This will allow you to search hundreds of different products made specifically for your ride.</p>
			<h5>How can I tell what size I should order?</h5>
			<p>Many items have size charts on the product page, and we are constantly working to get more size charts added to our site. Sizing can vary between manufacturers, so if you have specific questions, please call one of our sales professionals: 1-678-928-2123</p>
			<h5>Why doesn't the photo look the same as my part?</h5>
			<p>Many of the items we stock are available for a wide variety of applications. A single stock photo may be used to represent many items on our website. If you have profiled your ride, you can rest assured that the part ordered will fit your application. If you have any questions, please contact one of our sales professionals for assistance: 1-678-928-2123.</p>
